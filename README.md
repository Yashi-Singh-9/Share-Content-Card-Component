## Getting Started

### If Sass is Not Installed
You’ll need to install Sass to compile the `.scss` files into `.css`. Here’s how:
1. **Install Sass Globally** (requires Node.js):
   ```bash
   npm install -g sass
   ```
2. Check if Sass is installed:
   ```bash
   sass --version
   ```
3. Compile the `style.scss` file into `style.css`:
   ```bash
   sass style.scss style.css
   ```

Alternatively, if you don’t want to install Sass, you can use the precompiled `style.css` file included in the project. Simply skip the Sass compilation step.

---

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yashi-Singh-9/Share-Content-Card-Component.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Share-Content-Card-Component
   ```
3. **(Optional)** If you have Sass installed and want to recompile the styles, run:
   ```bash
   sass style.scss style.css
   ```

4. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the component.

---

### Usage
- Hover over social media icons to see the hover effects.
- Click the **Copy** button to copy the link to your clipboard.
- Resize your browser or use different devices to test the responsiveness.
